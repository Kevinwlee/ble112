# BLE112 #

I bought a bluegiga BLE112 mounted on a breakout board from [hardwarebreakout.com](

My goal is to be able to build an application on the built-in microcontroller, and communicate with my phone.  I have acheived the baseline goal: I can toggle timed LED from my phone.  There is still much exploring left to do.

See [notes.md](/notes.md), where I'm trying to put together all of the resources I am finding around the web about the BLE112, and the TI Bluetooth LE SoC in general.

See [programming.md](/programming.md), for information on programming the BLE112.  This is a bit specific to bluegiga devices.  I have an example program where you can control an LED using your Bluetooth LE enabled phone.
