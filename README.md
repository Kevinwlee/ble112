# BLE112 #

I bought a bluegiga BLE112 mounted on a breakout board from [hardwarebreakout.com](

My goal is to be able to build an application on the built-in microcontroller, and communicate with my phone.

See [notes.md](/notes.md), where I'm trying to put together all of the resources I am finding around the web.
